<div style="margin-top: 30px;">
    <svg width="500" height="300">
        <!--Must set stroke-width with stroke
            Remember many CSS properties do not work on SVGs

            Also the stroke is thinner on the left and top, but the bottom and right side
            are smaller.  This is because of overflow.  Browsers will hide shapes 
            outside the bounds of the SVG element.

            Strokes are generated by applying half the width inside the element, and
            half the width on the outside.

            To fix this you can add style="overflow: visible" to the SVG itself
            <svg width="500" height="500" style="overflow: visible">
        -->
        <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#F44336" stroke="#8BC34A" stroke-width="10"></rect>

        <!--
            Understand that our SVG image is 500px x 500px
            Meaning the X and Y coordinates are 500px each
            Starting from the top left, we can give a coordinate system

            Note these numbers could even be negative and can escape the SVG image if needed.
        -->
        <rect x="250" y="150" width="100" height="100" fill="red" stroke="black" stroke-width="10"></rect>
        <!--
            Circle has one required attribute, the radius 'r'

            The coordinates for circles are identified as cx and cy instead of x and y respectively
        -->
        <circle r="50" cx="420" cy="150" fill="#9c27B0"></circle>
        <!--
            Required attributes for a line,
                x1, y1 -> These are where the line should start
                x2, y2 -> These are where the line should finish
                stroke -> color
                stroke-width -> width of the line
        -->
        <line x1="50" y1="50" x2="200" y2="200" stroke="blue" stroke-width="10"></line>

        <!--
            Closing remarks here, depending on where these are placed
            One will be drawn over the other, so with this you will see that the line is over the
            original rectangle, but the line since it is last, will be drawn over everything
            before it.

            This is one of the flaws of SVG, the order matters.  We cannot use Z-index of a shape
            We will have to always order them correctly
